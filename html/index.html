                    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Encyclopedia Brian is an attempt to share some learnings on a variety of topics that I have found helpful in my own life. The content varies from informational to how-to to philosophical. This site does not intend to be any kind of all-encompassing lifestyle guide. It simply provides information that improved my life in some way or impacted the way Ilook at the world in a positive way. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This site's content is divided into five broad categories. Diet, Fitness, Money and Time Management are self-explanatory and apply to everyone to some extent. The supplements section contains information about a few performance-enhancing or mind-expanding substances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The information contained here will not appeal to everyone. Nor do I necessarily recommend applying concepts that may appeal to you in the exact same way I did. However, I have thoroughly researched all topics presented here and provided citations for my sources so that you may dig deeper into anything that interests you. And I recommend doing so before making any changes in your life based on anything you read here.

                    <h2>Who is Brian?</h2>
                    <P>
                        I have been fortunate enough to achieve some financial independence from a relatively young age. While this did involve a good deal of luck, I also worked very hard. For the record, my parents paid for my undergraduate education but have not supported me financially since.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        With financial independence came a fair amount of free time. I have used much of this free time to research topics I find interesting, optimize my regular routine and work on self-improvement. All with the goal of maintaining my independence for as long as possible. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't proclaim to be an expert in any particular field. However, I have incorporated everything presented in this site into my own life for long enough that I feel comfortable recommending it as something that everyone could at least consider, if not necessarily something that everyone should actually do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope that anyone who stumbles upon this site finds the information here at least thought-provoking, if not useful. Please feel free to contact me via email or social media if you have any questions or wish to discuss anything.
